    <h3>Day 2 - Oceania Sprint - Wagga Wagga</h3>
    <a>Today the sprint event was at the Charles Sturt University main campus. There were many people with peoblems so I was innundated with problems. Overall it was a success and we have sorted out the problems before tomorrow (Hopefully). The dinner was nice, I had a chicken wrap from Schnitz:</a>

    <h3>Day 3 - Australian Long - Cootamumdra</h3>
    <a>Today we had to wake up at 4:00 so everyone was a bit moody. It was a 2 hour drive to the event so we arrived at Cootamundra at around 7. Setup was pretty quick because we knew the setup from yesterday. The runners came in slowly but gradually picked up. Henry, one of the people doing the timing, had a person offer to slip a $20 to remove 15 minutes from their time. We had a very quick pack up as we were staying at the same place as the event is at the same place tomorrow. Here is a photo of the screen and PA in full operation:

    <h3>Day 4 - Oceania/Australian Relay - Cootamumdra</h3>
    <a>Today we woke up at 6:00 so it was a nice change from the really early starts so we got a full breakfast from the hotel. Mr Purcell, Angus and I arrived a few minutes before everyone else so we set up the LED Screen and took off the protection from the finish. Because we were at the same location two days in a row the infrastructure was pretty much all setup so we were ready to go. Things were pretty hectic at the finish tent (Henry, Kaelen and I) because the relays meant that the runners' data had to be sorted in a correct way and the orienteers changed their teams without telling us so that caused a lot of problems which I had to fix.

    <p>The people that were out on the cameras (Sithum, Toby and Xander) who were working for Toph (The person in charge of Live Production) returned at the end of the day a lot less sunburned then yesterday and were much happier although quite tired. We ended the day going out to an Indian place for dinner. I had a Tikka Masala and a Lemon, Lime and Bitters. We all had some Naan Bread and Samosas to share. Overall I think we all had a great day.</p>

    <h3>Day 5 - Schools Sprint/Public Day 1 - Wagga Wagga</h3>
    <a>
      Today was the shortest day of them all. The event was at a school that was a four minute drive away from the hotel so the transit to the event was nice. There were two events in one day so we had to swap the event on the software halfway through. This caused some problems because theer were still some runners out from the first event that arrived when we had converted to the second event. I was innundated with course changes so I didn't have time to eat lunch luckily we got pizza so I managed to eat a slice every few minutes. Kaelen and Henry got to have a break as the camera operators got bac before 12:00, so Sithum and Xander took over. Unfortunately, my job is too complicated so nobody is able to take over for me except for Mr purcell but he was working alongside me because there were so many changes as we were doing them for all three days. When we got back to the hotel we went to the pool because we had a free afternoon.

      We had a barbeque next to the pool for dinner. Toby was put in charge of cooking the sausages and burned every single one! It was fine because it was only a light burn and they were very well cooked on the inside. After dinner we went out on a walk and had some ice cream from Gelatissimo.
