    <h3>Day 2 - Oceania Sprint - Wagga Wagga</h3>
    <a>Today the sprint event was at the Charles Sturt University main campus. There were many people with peoblems so I was innundated with problems. Overall it was a success and we have sorted out the problems before tomorrow (Hopefully). The dinner was nice, I had a chicken wrap from Schnitz:</a>

    <h3>Day 3 - Australian Long - Cootamumdra</h3>
    <a>Today we had to wake up at 4:00 so everyone was a bit moody. It was a 2 hour drive to the event so we arrived at Cootamundra at around 7. Setup was pretty quick because we knew the setup from yesterday. The runners came in slowly but gradually picked up. Henry, one of the people doing the timing, had a person offer to slip a $20 to remove 15 minutes from their time. We had a very quick pack up as we were staying at the same place as the event is at the same place tomorrow. Here is a photo of the screen and PA in full operation:

    <h3>Day 4 - Oceania/Australian Relay - Cootamumdra</h3>
    <a>Today we woke up at 6:00 so it was a nice change from the really early starts so we got a full breakfast from the hotel. Mr Purcell, Angus and I arrived a few minutes before everyone else so we set up the LED Screen and took off the protection from the finish. Because we were at the same location two days in a row the infrastructure was pretty much all setup so we were ready to go. Things were pretty hectic at the finish tent because the relays meant that the runners' data had to be sorted in a correct way and the orienteers changed their teams without telling us so that caused a lot of problems which I had to fix.

    <p>The people that were out on the cameras (Sithum, Toby and Xander) who were working for Toph (The person in charge of Live Production) returned at the end of the day a lot less sunburned then yesterday and were much happier although quite tired. We ended the day going out to an Indian place for dinner. I had a Tikka Masala and a Lemon, Lime and Bitters. We all had some Naan Bread and Samosas to share. Overall I think we all had a great day.</p>
